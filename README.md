CS 300 Projects
**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

The problems being solve in the projects for this course were the ability to read a document that contained school courses. I was then asked to sort those courses, and allow the user to search for a specific course, print the list of courses, and upload the information for the courses. 

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

I approached the problemed armed with the assignments we had done so far in the course. The project was really asking us to apply one of the algorithms we learned (linked lists, hashtables, vector sorting, search tree) to the task at hand. I think it is important to understand data structures because they show that there are many different ways to solve the problem and each of those have their own pros and cons. 

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

I looked back to a lot of our zybooks work and previous work I had done to help jump over any roadblocks. Our other data structure assignments helped me the most when running into any issues adjusting the lists. 

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I think this project has restrengethed my attention towards the compounding nature of coding skills. Praciticing each skill and using it over and over again will help future development

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I think the nature of this project being one that gave me many options in how would solve the problem, forced me to make more readble and adaptable code. For this code to be tested or edited by someone else, it needed clear commenting and the ability to be changed easily.
